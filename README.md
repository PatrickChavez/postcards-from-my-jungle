## Reflection

The creation of the website was a step-by-step process that involved a lot of trial and error, in addition to a lot of waiting. 

The first step was to use the provided diffusion model to generate the animals. I chose the [“animal-wildlife” dataset by lucabaggi](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucabaggi/animal-wildlife) due to the theme of the assignment focusing on the jungle, a place that has an abundance of different creatures. When training the model, I used anywhere from 5 to 250 epochs. Some interesting patterns I noticed was that on lower settings (around 5 to 15 epochs), all of the images bore a turquoise hue. Similarly, the highest setting (250 epochs) gave me images with a green hue. The images with the brown hues (around 100 to 200 epochs) are the one’s I felt the most satisfied, as they are colors that I associate with wildlife. I common problem that I encountered when image generating were the frequent GPU usage limits on Google Colab. Due to my recklessness with the model training, by the image I was able to generate images with the newly trained model, the GPU would time-out during the image-creation phase, meaning that I would have to wait hours before I could generate a new batch, which left me quite miffed. 

As for the audio, I decided against using Stable Audio Open, due to the program needing my contact information. After a few tries with different models and many troubles with getting Google Gemini to set up a proper sound generator, I finally settled on [“audioldm-s-full-v2” by cvssp](https://huggingface.co/cvssp/audioldm-s-full-v2). The prompts focused on chimera-esque animals interacting with each other, to keep in line with the assignment’s theme of fictional animals. The model only managed to generate static-like sounds. Perhaps I should have used a more refined modal or bit the bullet and used Stable Audio Open.

For the fictional language, I simply asked "gpt-4.1-nano" and Google Gemini to create a “Chimera Language”. The website was also generated by Google Gemini. The only changes I made were the background and the font.
